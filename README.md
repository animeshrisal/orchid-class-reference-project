# Reference Project

Hello Students.

This is a project that I have made for you to reference in your own projects.

This project contains some extra stuff that has not been covered in class yet but I have left comments explaining what the code does in detail.

This project is a more advanced version of the todo list that we have done.

The following project includes:-

1. User Authentication
2. Post Creation
3. Error Validation
4. Admin Panel

This app, while it does have some frontend styling, I didn't wanna spend too much time on it as the main focus here is writing the python code.

However I have done positioning of the elements so thats it's easier to know the layout. I've used flexbox to position them elements.

If you're interested in understanding the css of this project then please do this
exercise

[Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

It should take you at max 30 mintues to understand how flexbox works using this exercise.
