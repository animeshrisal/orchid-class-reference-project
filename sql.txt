create table user(
    id int primary key auto_increment,
    name varchar(20),
    hash varchar(40),
    isAdmin boolean
);

# isAdmin is a boolean to check if the user is an admin or not

create table post(
    id int primary key auto_increment,
    title varchar(50),
    description varchar(200),
    userId int,
    foreign key (userId) references user(id) on delete cascade
);

# you may notice there is delete cascade in the foreign key. this is because if you do not use delete cascade and if you try to delete
a record from user that already has a post it will not let you delete is as there are posts that have the foreign key of that user.
so if you add delete cascade when you delete a user, it will delete all the posts that are associcated with the user.
